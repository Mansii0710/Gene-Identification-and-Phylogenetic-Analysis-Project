# Gene-Identification-and-Phylogenetic-Analysis-Project
This Python project identifies similar genes (gapA, infB, mdh, pgi, phoE, rpoB, and tonB) across multiple genome contigs with: - 100% query coverage - Minimum 95% sequence identity.  It also builds a phylogenetic tree using Maximum Likelihood with bootstrapping.
